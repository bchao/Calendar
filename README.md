soCal - 3.0.0
===========


A calendar web app created for ECE 458 - Software Maintainability
 
#### Getting Started

* Install node using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). We suggest using the cURL install script.
* Make sure you have MongoDB installed as well.  
* git clone this repo into your working directory  
* cd into the project directory
* You now must install the dependencies that are embedded within the project. Do so by typing

 `$ npm install`  

#### View production version
The app is being hosted at [https://socal-458.herokuapp.com](https://socal-458.herokuapp.com/). 

#### Running the app locally
 1. Navigate to the project directory
 
 2. Spin up a mongoDB instance by typing

  `$ mongod --dbpath ./data/db`
 3. Open new terminal window and type

  `$ node ./bin/www`
 4. The server is now running and listening on localhost:3000! A verification statement that the DB had successfully connected should be console logged at this point in time.
